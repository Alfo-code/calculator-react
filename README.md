This is a solution to a solo project from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn).<br/>
Solo projects are meant to challenge the skills you've learnt so far through the courses; no solution is given.

## The challenge

## Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3 custom properties
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- npm - Vite

## Future improvements
  
- [ ] Ability to do more complex operations
